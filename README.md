## About

Initially I designed this project with the thought of creating a website that could be updated regularly by the creators of an RPG game. The website would allow for developers and artists to get critical data from one another about a fantasy world. As I worked on the project more, I found it compelling and fun to develop a NPC generator and Fantasy Character Stat calculator. 

The end result is a simple platform where people can create characters and view possible character statistics locally. I am looking forward to refactoring this in the near future using many of the skills gained in the JavaScript Code Louisville course.

## Feature List:

1. Create an array, dictionary or list, populate it with multiple values, retrieve at least one value, and use or display it in your application

Location: ` public/assets/js/scripts.js ` & ` public/form.html `

2. Create a form and save the values (on click of Submit button) to an external file 
You must show us or document where that information is being stored so we can confirm that itâ€™s being saved/persisted

Location: ` public/assets/js/main.js ` & ` public/form.html ` , ` data/app.json `

DEV API Location: `public/assets/js/api.js` , `server/index.js` & `public/assets/js/main.js `

3. Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format

Location: ` public/assets/js/emailvalidate.js ` , `public/form.html `

## Additional Features:

- Colors display on form through array data on ` public/form.html ` using  `public/assets/js/scripts.js`

- Fantasy Character Stat Calculator on ` stat.html ` and `public/assets/js/rank.js `

- Bootstrap 5 Responsive Layout
