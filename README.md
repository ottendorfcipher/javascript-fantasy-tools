## About

This is a custom app built for the primary of creating, viewing, modifying, and exporting data into the .json format. From there, certain types of data are tagged to be viewed by certain people. 

As a simple proof-of-concept, the project will store user-inputted data about a fantasy world. Data is inputted on a form and then sent to a table for public viewing as well as views for certain people (such as artists, developers, business leads, etc.).

Responses will also have a graphical visual representation.

## Feature List:

1. Create an array, dictionary or list, populate it with multiple values, retrieve at least one value, and use or display it in your application

Location: ` public/assets/js/scripts.js ` & ` public/form.html `

2. Create a form and save the values (on click of Submit button) to an external file 
You must show us or document where that information is being stored so we can confirm that itâ€™s being saved/persisted

Location: ` public/assets/js/main.js ` & ` public/form.html ` , ` data/app.json `

DEV API Location: `public/assets/js/api.js` , `server/index.js` & `public/assets/js/main.js `

3. Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format

Location: ` public/assets/js/emailvalidate.js ` , `public/form.html `

4. Create and use a function that accepts two or more values (parameters), calculates or determines a new value based on those inputs, and returns a new value
