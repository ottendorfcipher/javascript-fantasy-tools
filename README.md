# Project Management App

## About

This is a custom app built for the primary of creating, viewing, modifying, and exporting data into the .json format. From there, certain types of data are tagged to be viewed by certain people. 

As a simple proof-of-concept, the project will store user-inputted data about a fantasy world. Data is inputted on a form and then sent to a table for public viewing as well as views for certain people (such as artists, developers, business leads, etc.).

Responses will also have a graphical visual representation.
